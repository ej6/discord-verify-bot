# discord-verify-bot
just a super simple discord bot that will give a someone who joins a role when they say verify in the chat
all you have to do is turn on developer mode on in discord and get the role id you want and put it where it says to same with the bots token get it and put it where it says
you kind of have to setup the server to work with the bot but thats pretty simple and self explanatory and if you cant do that i dont know what to tell you lel
